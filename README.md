# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This project provide visualization of all the sorting algorithms, (i.e. how sorting algorithms sort the array).

# Deployed Link: https://all-sorting-algorithms-visualizer.vercel.app/

Currently, visualization is available for five algorithms 

- Quick sort
- Merge sort
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
